Weather App is a HTML, CSS & JavaScript based app for fetching the real time weather information of all the cities across the world. It displays the weather information such as temperature, humidity and wind speed along with different symbols according to the conditions (sunny, snow, rain, etc).

I have used API call to fetch real time weather information from the website (openweathermap.org)

This is the first page of the app, just after launching.

Thia is how the page looks after fetching the weather information.
